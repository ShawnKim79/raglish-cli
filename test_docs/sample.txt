The document contains information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
AI has become increasingly important in modern technology.
Machine learning algorithms can process large amounts of data to find patterns.

Natural language processing is a subset of AI that deals with human language.
It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to solve complex problems.
These networks can learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
