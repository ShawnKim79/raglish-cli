1. INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING

Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to execute specific tasks. Modern programming involves not just writing code, but understanding software architecture, user experience, and system design principles.

Key Programming Concepts:
- Algorithm design and problem-solving
- Data representation and manipulation
- Control flow and program structure
- Input/output operations and user interaction
- Error handling and debugging techniques

Programming Languages Overview:
- High-level languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, C#)
- Low-level languages (C, C++, Assembly)
- Scripting languages (Python, Ruby, Perl)
- Functional languages (Haskell, Lisp, Scala)
- Domain-specific languages (SQL, HTML, CSS)

================================================================================

2. PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS

Variables and Data Types:
Variables store data values that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. Common data types include:

- Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 42, -17, 0)
- Floating-point: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5)
- Strings: Text data (e.g., "Hello World", "Programming")
- Booleans: True/false values
- Arrays/Lists: Collections of related data
- Objects: Complex data structures with properties and methods

Control Structures:
Control structures determine the flow of program execution:

- Conditional statements (if/else): Execute code based on conditions
- Loops (for, while): Repeat code blocks multiple times
- Switch/case statements: Multi-way branching based on values
- Exception handling: Manage errors and unexpected situations

Functions and Procedures:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks:

- Function definition and parameters
- Return values and scope
- Recursion and recursive algorithms
- Lambda functions and closures
- Function composition and higher-order functions

================================================================================

3. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)

Object-oriented programming organizes code into objects that contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Core OOP Principles:

Encapsulation:
- Bundling data and methods within objects
- Access modifiers (private, protected, public)
- Getter and setter methods for controlled access
- Information hiding and data protection

Inheritance:
- Creating new classes based on existing ones
- Parent-child class relationships
- Method overriding and polymorphism
- Multiple inheritance and interface implementation

Abstraction:
- Hiding complex implementation details
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Defining contracts for class behavior
- Simplifying complex systems through abstraction layers

Polymorphism:
- Objects of different types responding to the same interface
- Method overloading and overriding
- Dynamic binding and late binding
- Interface-based programming

Class Design Principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

================================================================================

4. DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

Algorithm Analysis:
Understanding algorithm efficiency and performance:

Time Complexity:

================================================================================

5. SOFTWARE DESIGN PATTERNS

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems:

Creational Patterns:
- Singleton: Ensure only one instance of a class exists
- Factory: Create objects without specifying exact classes
- Builder: Construct complex objects step by step
- Prototype: Create objects by cloning existing instances

Structural Patterns:
- Adapter: Allow incompatible interfaces to work together
- Decorator: Add new functionality to objects dynamically
- Facade: Provide simplified interface to complex subsystems
- Composite: Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly

Behavioral Patterns:
- Observer: Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- Strategy: Define family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- Command: Encapsulate requests as objects
- State: Allow objects to alter behavior when internal state changes

Architectural Patterns:
- Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separate concerns in applications
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM): Data binding and presentation logic
- Repository Pattern: Encapsulate data access logic
- Dependency Injection: Manage object dependencies
